# For production we are:
# Removing any volume bindings for application code, so that code stays inside the container and canâ€™t be changed from outside
# Binding to different ports on the host
# Setting environment variables differently (e.g., to decrease the verbosity of logging, or to enable email sending)
# Specifying a restart policy (e.g., restart: always) to avoid downtime
# Adding extra services (e.g., a log aggregator)
